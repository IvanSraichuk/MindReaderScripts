    "\n",
    "*There are a [myriad](https://scholar.google.nl/scholar?as_sdt=1,5&q=peak+detection+ECG&hl=nl&as_ylo=2018) of different QRS detectors. Most of those consists of two stages:*\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Stage 1 — Signal transformation\n",
    "**Construct a signal that maximises the features of interest, in our case this is the QRS-complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Stage 2 — Decision rule \n",
    "**Use a threshold to separate the desired features from the rest of the signal\n",
    "\n",
    "A lot of peak detectors use a very neat trick for transforming the signal (stage 1) and I found it worth diving into that. It’s called [template matching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_matching).\n",
    "\n",
    "Template matching is widely used in pattern recognition, for example in [particle analysis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15065671), cryptanalysis, [computer vision](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/272496016_Template_Matching_Techniques_in_Computer_Vision_Theory_and_Practice) and [computational neuroscience](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/cin/2014/919406/). It’s an elegant and powerful technique that uses a filter (also known as template or kernel), that contains a **specific feature** and use that filter to find this feature in a larger signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Cross-correlation is a measure of the similarity between two signals (image taken from [Giphy](https://media.giphy.com/media/VVPKOXc6aY1Lq/source.gif))](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*mWsGTGVdAsy6KoF3n3MyLA.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "Basic idea is to slide the filter along a signal and compute the [cross-correlation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-correlation) between the filter and the signal. If the filter matches a part of the signal closely, there is a strong correlation, which is another way of saying this part of the signal looks a lot like the feature in the filter. By setting a threshold (stage 2), you are able to find features you’re interested in.\n",
    ">  Cross-correlation is often referred to as **convolution**, which is a slightly different operation where the filter is reversed f(t) -› f(-t) before sliding it along the signal. Convolutional Neural Networks should actually be named Cross-correlation Networks, but i guess that didn’t make it through the marketing department :-)\n",
    "\n",
    "In images you could use this technique to find horizontal or vertical edges by designing specific filters. Convolutional Networks take this approach even further and learn filters that are relevant for certain classes automatically using back propagation.\n",

    "The most popular HRV metric is the Root Mean Square of Successive Differences or RMSSD. ****It’s a measure for how much variation there exists in the heart rate. In a healthy heart, there is a natural variation, which is due to a balance between the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and parasympathetic parts (PSNS) of the Autonomous Nervous System. If your body experiences stress, then the sympathetic system will activate, to prepare for fight or flight behaviour, and your heartrate will increase. The parasympathetic controls your body’s “rest and digest” responses and is associated with recovery. Parasympathetic activation conserves energy, constricts pupils, aids digestion, and slows your heart rate. These two parts of the nervous system are normally in a healthy balance, causing a natural variation in heart. If this balance is disturbed for any reason, this variance will change. A lower RMSSD is associated with stress and various illnesses.\n",

To interpolate, we first transform our list with RR-intervals to a time series were we arrange RR-intervals over time. To find the time points for each interval, we sum up the values of the RR-intervals. Next, we create an interpolation function that we can use to sample from with any resolution we want. We use a resolution of 4 samples per second. Now we can create an evenly spaced set of datapoints that we can use for the frequency analysis.\n"
